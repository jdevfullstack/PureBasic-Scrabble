This is a scrabble game written in PureBasic.

When playing, better play this 
with a dictionary,
I intentionally did not include any standard dictionary
so that learners/students will be engaged in 
playing this game, doing some manual
researches for those words.

There are four sets
and when you click 'Reset'
your score/s will be counted.

And you can always change these things as per requirement of yours.

## The Good Old Days
PureBasic was my first ever programming language, so it reminds me of the good old days. 
Before PureBasic, I first learned Excel formulas, which really captured my interest. 
The very first time I encountered Excel was in college,
and it was the IF function presented by the professor that really caught my attention.
