# PureBasic Mini-Scrabble
This is a scrabble game written in PureBasic.

![GUI](sampleGUI.png)

When playing, better play this 
with a dictionary,
I intentionally not included any standard dictionary
so that learners/students will be engaged in 
playing this game, doing some manual
researches for those words.

There are four sets
and when you click 'Reset'
your score/s will be counted.

And you can always change these things as per requirement of yours.

## Compiling
To compile/run, just use the PureBasic IDE, that's very fast and
simple for simple programs like this.
